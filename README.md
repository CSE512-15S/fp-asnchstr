Herbie Interactive Exploration
==============================

Alex Sanchez-Stern asnchstr@uw.edu

A project to allow exploration of the accuracy of floating point
expressions and their potential improvements.

Installation
============

This project uses the Herbie tool as a submodule, so when you clone it
you'll want to use `git clone --recursive
http://github.com/CSE512-15S/fp-asnchstr`. If you'd rather clone it
the normal way, or have already cloned it, just run `make deps` to
install the submodule.

To run the Herbie server and tool, you'll neet Racket, which is
available at (www.racket-lang.org)[http://www.racket-lang.org].
