For my final project, I want to create a web interface for my research
tool, Herbie. The basic idea is, a user can enter an expression, and
that expression becomes an alternative that the user can visually see
represented abstractly. Next, the improve loop allows the user to
select an alternative, expand it to be fully shown, call localize to
have the error-prone nodes highlighted, select any node or all nodes
and either rewrite or generate series to attempt to fix that error,
and when done, combine all alts to create a final combination. The
user can also revert steps, and easily explore the space.
