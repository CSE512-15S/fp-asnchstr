\section{Literature Review}

As far as I can tell, the techniques I'm presenting are novel, as they
are pretty specific to the type of tool which I am creating an
interface for. The paper outlining the Herbie tool is central to the
techniques, and can be found at
http://herbie.uwplse.org/pldi15-herbie.pdf .

\section{Project Plan}

My plan is to break the project into three smaller chunks. First, I
will get a rough version of the interface going that will be able to
present what is shown on the slides in an unpolished manner using
dummy data. Then, I will set up the mechanisms through which the
interface will communicate with the existing Herbie server which my
collegue is developing. Finally, as much as time permits I will
generalize the interface to include taylor series as well as rewrites,
to function properly on all expressions, and generally polish the
interface.
